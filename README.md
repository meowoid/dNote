==========

dNote is a simple note taking app developed by Digutsoft.
This includes one line note taking, multi line note taking, note taking from Android Wear.

dNote is simple but powerful, so writing and managing notes are very convenient.
You can create your own category to save note, and both short and long note can be added easily.
You can set title to note, so you can easily look up what is the content of the note.
Also, you can pin note in the status bar, so you don't need to switch between app to copy note content.
You can share the note, but category sharing option also provided, so you can easily share all the notes in a category.
If you have an Android Wear device paired with your smartphone, you can take a note to dNote using "Take a note" voice command.

Seven options to manage your note is provided, and more options will be provided via updates.
No ads, and clear and easy UI also provided.

And also this is the second open-source project of [Digutsoft](http://www.digutsoft.com) and I'm not very good at using Git, so there can be lots of mistakes in Git. If you find them, please notice me! :D
